Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 // solution : 

class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] words = s.trim().split("\\s+");
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            result.append(words[i]);
            if (i != 0) 
                result.append(" ");
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
